        I want to build a recipe sharing platform called CookTogether. 
        
        The app will let home cooks share their family recipes with beautiful photography,
        step-by-step video tutorials, and ingredient substitution suggestions. Users can
        save recipes, create meal plans, generate shopping lists, and follow other cooks.
        
        It solves the problem of recipe fragmentation - people have recipes scattered
        across Pinterest, Instagram, random blogs, and handwritten cards. This brings
        them all together in one place with social features.
        
        For style, I want a warm, homey aesthetic like Kinfolk magazine meets modern
        minimalism. Think cream backgrounds, serif typography for headings (maybe 
        Playfair Display), clean sans-serif for body text, lots of whitespace, and
        beautiful food photography as the hero element.
        
        The primary users are millennials and Gen X home cooks who want to preserve
        family recipes digitally and discover new ones. Secondary users are food
        bloggers who want a dedicated recipe platform. They need easy recipe entry,
        beautiful presentation, and social features to build community.
        
        My dream is for this to become the GitHub of recipes - where every family's
        cooking heritage is preserved, versioned, and shared. I envision partnerships
        with cookbook publishers and cooking schools, maybe even a marketplace for
        specialty ingredients.
